Patch to make INK playable on PS Vita~~

~~###~~

~~## Disclaimer
This patch does not contain any game files from INK. **You need the game files from your legally owned copy**.
If you don't have a copy of the game, you can buy it [HERE](https://store.steampowered.com/app/385710/INK/)
It **WILL NOT WORK* with a pirated copy of the game due to hash check.~~

~~## Instructions (Read them carefully)~
~1. Download the VPK and install it on your hacked PS Vita~
~2. In your PC, open the folder when you have installed INK (Steam only at the moment). If you only have a .exe, extract it with 7zip.~
~3. Download the patch for your version and extract it in that folder. After that, run `apply_patch.bat`. This will create a folder called `Patched_Files`~
~4. If everything went correctly, your Patched_Files folders will have a file called `eboot.bin` and a folder called `games` with a `game.win` file.~
~5. Copy `eboot.bin` and the `games` folder and move them to the vita, `ux0:app/INKV00000`. Overwrite when prompted. ~
~6. Copy every `.ogg` file from your PC's INK folder to `ux0:app/INKV00000/games`~

~~**IMPORTANT:** This patch is not confirmed to work with any other version that it's not the current latest build of Steam~~
